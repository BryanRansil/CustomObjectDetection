# Deep Learning Retraining on a Tumblr Blog

This is a small sample on how one can retrain the top layer of a model with
unorthodox data. There are a large number of blogs on Tumblr with plenty of
tagged images. If these tags are used as labels, one could make a model that
predicts how an image will be classified.

# Motive

So why would I spend time to do this?
1. I've been playing around with retraining Inception for a while, so wanted to use those skills in a new context.
2. This a small test of my ability to quickly grab data from an unorthodox source and apply it to a deep learning context. This is an essential skill given how important one's data is for training.
